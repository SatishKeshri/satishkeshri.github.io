👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Research Assistant at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology - Delhi (IIIT - Delhi) in India.

🔬 I am currently working on efficient optimization algorithms for Continual Learning in centralized and federated learning setups. My research interests are in Theoretical Machine Learning, Federated Learning and Continual Learning.

📚 I have completed my Master's in Data Science and Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computing. I have deep understanding on various mathematical topics required for theoritical machine learning like Calculus (Single and Multivariable), Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Optimization Algorithms to name a few.

📽️ I am also interested in building machine learning models for production environment part of which I learned during my career as a Data Scientist.

🎨 I love cycling 🚴 and playing Badminton ☄

# Selected Experience

## 📜 Research Experience
I have experience with independent research. My recent work on Continual Learning for Federated Setup has been submitted to NeurIps, 2024. In this work I formulate a new training method for continual setups to have provable convergence gurantess in a non-convex setting.

## 💼 Professional Experience
I worked as a **Data Scientist** for 3 years at Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, India at their R&D Centre. My primary role included building NLP based AI models and productionizing them.
