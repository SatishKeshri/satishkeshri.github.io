👨🏻‍💻 I am a Research Assistant at the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI), <a href="https://iiitd.ac.in" target="_blank"> IIIT-Delhi</a>, India hosted by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ranjithap/home" target="_blank"> Dr. Ranjitha Prasad</a>.

🔬 My primary research interest is in machine learning, distributed learning and natural language processing. Specifically, I am interested in continual/lifelong learning, federated learning and privacy-preserving machine learning. I try to solve the problems through optimizational point-of-view as well as using Bayesian learning techniques.

<!-- continual/lifelong learning and Bayesian deep learning. Humans are naturally capable of lifelong learning and can retain knowledge over time. However, providing computer algorithms with similar cognitive capabilities remains a compelling yet challenging task. Through my research, I want to understand how to develop efficient yet adaptive lifelong learners which are good at handling the sequential task dynamics. I study this through the lens of optimization and probabilistic modelling with emphasis on efficient memory schemes for replay memory. -->

Humans are naturally capable of lifelong learning and can retain knowledge over time. However, providing computer algorithms with similar cognitive capabilities remains a challenging yet very compelling task. Through my research, I want to understand how to develop efficient yet adaptive lifelong learners which are good at handling the sequential task dynamics. Currently, I study this through the lens of model parameter optimization and probabilistic modelling with emphasis on efficient memory schemes for replay memory. In future, I would like to study how to make transformers and self-attention mechanisms more efficient and adaptive to evolving task dynamics <!--to handle out-of-distribution scenarios in a parameter effcient manner. -->

I am also interested in building distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning and deep learning models through collaborative (federated) learning . Recently, growing data privacy concerns have introduced significant obstacles in developing safe ML models for sensitive applications. I aim to develop federated learning algorithms for safe, reliable and robust ML applications.

<!-- 📚 I have completed my master's in Data Science and undergraduation in Mathematics and Computing. I have hands-on experience in building deep learning models and a deep understanding of various mathematical topics required for theoretical deep learning such as Calculus (Single and Multivariable), Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Optimization Algorithms.


📽️ I am also interested in developing machine learning models for production environments, a skill I honed during my career as a Data Scientist.

<!-- # Selected Experience



## 📜 Research Experience
Currently, I am working as a pre-doctoral Research Assistant at IIIT-Delhi with Prof. Ranjitha Prasad. My research focus is on building efficient lifelong/continual learners and privacy-preserving ML for applications in healtcare, autonomous vehicles and surveillence. My recent work on Continual Federated Learning has been accepted at the conference CODS COMAD 2024 and a longer version is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07959v1). -->


<!-- ## 💼 Professional Experience
I worked as a **Data Scientist** for around 3 years at Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, India at their R&D Centre. My primary role involved developing AI applications using supervised machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Additionally, I led a small, dynamic team of data scientists as the project lead and facilitated the production deployment of our solutions. -->
