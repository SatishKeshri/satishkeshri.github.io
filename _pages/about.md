👨🏻‍💻 I am a pre-doctoral Research Assistant at the Infosys Centre for Artificial Intelligence, IIIT-Delhi, India.

🔬 I am currently working on efficient optimization algorithms for Continual Learning in centralized and federated learning setups. My research interests are in Continual Learning, Bayesian Deep Learning and Decentralized ML.

📚 I have completed my master's in Data Science and undergraduation in Mathematics and Computing. I have hands-on experience in building deep learning models and a deep understanding of various mathematical topics required for theoretical deep learning such as Calculus (Single and Multivariable), Linear Algebra, Probability Theory and Optimization Algorithms.


📽️ I am also interested in developing machine learning models for production environments, a skill I honed during my career as a Data Scientist.

🏆 I love cycling 🚴 and playing Badminton 🏸

# Selected Experience

## 📜 Research Experience
Currently, I am working as a pre-doctoral Research Assistant at IIIT-Delhi with Prof. Ranjitha Prasad. My research focus is on building efficient lifelong/continual learners and privacy-preserving ML for applications in healtcare, autonomous vehicles and surveillence. My recent work on Continual Federated Learning has been accepted at the conference CODS_COMAD 2024 and a longer version is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07959v1).


## 💼 Professional Experience
I worked as a **Data Scientist** for around 3 years at Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, India at their R&D Centre. My primary role involved developing AI applications using supervised machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. Additionally, I led a small, dynamic team of data scientists as the project lead and facilitated the production deployment of our solutions.
