👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Research Assistant at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology - Delhi (IIIT - Delhi) in India.

🔬 I am currently working on Continual Learning in centralized and Federated learning setups. My research interests are in Federated Learning, Continual Learning. and theoretical Machine Learning.

📚 I have completed my Master's in Data Science and Bacherlor's in Mathematics and Computing. I have deep understanding on various mathematical topics required for theoritical machine learning like Calculus (single and multi-variable), Linear Algebra, Probability theory, Optimization Algorithms to name a few.

📽️ I am also interested in building machine learning models for production environment part of which I learned during my career as a Data Scientist at Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, India.

🎨 I love cycling 🚴 and playing Badminton ☄
